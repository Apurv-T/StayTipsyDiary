# StayTipsyDiary
An android application that can help users track and view their daily consumption of alcohol, cannabis and cigarettes. Myself and three other students worked on this project where we designed and developed the application as part of our Software Engineering course.

## Challenge & Proposed Solution
Heavy consumption of alcohol and cannabis not only causes social issues but also economis anc mental health issues. There are not many user friendly apps that can help to tackle your consumption and show reports over time.

Stay Tipsy Diary can help you track and view reports of your consumption over time. Although it is not designed to drastically reduce your consumtion in a period of time but is made to help track and reduce consumption gradually. 

## Starting Up
After discussing and brain storming we started making the user stores with our clients(TA and Professor). These are some of the main user stories:

After passing acceptance test, we started working on the application while practicing Extreme Programming. We were able to transform the user stories into these layouts:



## Development
The application was completed in an Extreme Programming environment while practicing peer programming. This was our first time working in peers and I found it very helpful for everyone, as everybody took part in the programming, was aware of the project status and deadlines.

## Issues
We faced various issues throughout the implementation of our ideas to our app. for the first 24 hours, the challenge was to decide whether or not we wanted to develop the app on iOS or Android. As Android offers more in terms of freedom to control the phone, however it did not have the polish we wanted that iOS could give. 

We also wanted to make sure that we could deliver a completely hands free functional assistant, and while we had a way to do so on iOS, we weren't sure if that would be a possibiblity on Android, as it needs some form of user touch before it can take in a speech to text input. 

## Result

## Future Plans
Figuring out integration of the passive commands would be plans for the near future, continuing into the far future development would be focused on getting integration and support for custom commands to be fully functional. Also, we had an odd error getting the application to run on actual phones rather than just the XCode simulated phones. Looking into this major issue would be the next task we take on.
