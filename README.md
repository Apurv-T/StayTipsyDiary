# StayTipsyDiary
An android application that can help users track and view their daily consumption of alcohol, cannabis and cigarettes. Myself and three other students worked on this project where we designed and developed the application as part of our Software Engineering course.

## Challenge & Proposed Solution
Heavy consumption of alcohol and cannabis not only causes social issues but also economis anc mental health issues. There are not many user friendly apps that can help to tackle your consumption and show reports over time.

Stay Tipsy Diary can help you track and view reports of your consumption over time. Although it is not designed to drastically reduce your consumtion in a period of time but is made to help track and reduce consumption gradually. 

## Starting Up
After discussing and brainstorming ideas, we started with making the user stores with our clients(TA and Professor). These are some of the main user stories:

After passing acceptance test over the weeks, we started working on the application while practicing Extreme Programming. We were able to transform the user stories into these layouts:

## Development
The application was completed in an Extreme Programming environment while practicing peer programming. This was our first time working in peers and I found it very helpful, as everybody took part in the programming and was aware of the project status and deadlines.

### Programming Languages:Java, JSON
### IDE: Android Stuido, VS Code
### Version Control: Git, GitLab
### Cloud Service: Firebase
### UI/Wireframe Tools: Sketch, Balsamiq, Canva



## Issues
We faced various issues throughout the implementation of our ideas to our app.The two main issues were:

### 1. Integrating Firebase:
  Integrating firebase in the application was required for user login and for storing user data. This became a challenge in the team to implement it as the other three members were not experienced with Firebase integration. As I had some experience building android apps with firebase, I immidately jumped in and did a 2 hours Firebase session with the whole team. I helped them understand uses of Firebase and how to integrate it in the applications. This helped us complete the user story before dealines.
  ### 2. Merging branches into Master:
  As this was the first course that required us to use version control for working together and to share code with the professor, we were not fully familiar with merging branches into the main branch. The first time we tried merging the branches, we faced a lot of issues and overlaps. As the team had strong communication between members, we quickly held a 3 hour session to understand the merge and fix the issues.



## Future Plans
Due to time constraints we were not able to provide real data to the graphs and hence used hard coded values. We would like to fix this issue and include some more animations in the application and make it more user friendly. We would also like to add a feature where the user can email the reports and charts tot their doctors for medical purposes.
